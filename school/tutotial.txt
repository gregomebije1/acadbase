Design Decisions while building acadbase:
=====================================================
1. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
2. Less is More 
  (Concentrate only on the most important features and leave everything thing else out.
   Except of course, if a lot of customers actually want a particular feature.)
3. Make it fast and secure. 


What happens when a User Sign's up? (Simplified version)
=============================================================
1. School name and email is added to the DB.
2. If a certain School's name is not in the directory it is added. 
   NB: Later on, whenever school information is updated, directory information is also updated. 
   
3. Create's a user using the email and assigns a proprietor access (Can access everything) to it. (May be no longer relevant)
4. Create's a General Ledger account for the school to track payments made later on.
5. Give's the School a "1 month free subscription".
6. Adds the following class types to the school: Nursery, Primary, JSS, SSS.
7. Adds 4 sample classes to the school: Nursery 1, Class1, JSS1A, SSS1A
8. Adds two subjects (Mathematics and English) to each sample class.
9. Adds a session using the current date. 
  So if for instance we are in 2012, it will create 2011/2012 session.
10. Adds First, Second and Third term to this session. 
11. Sends an email to the user.
12. Automatically logs in the user to "Test Drive" the software.
13. Brings up a popup, to choose Session/Term/Class. 


A brief explanation of some of the menus that may not be clear
================================================================
Promote/Demote: Promotes or Demotes Students. 
        A session to promote/demote to must exist before the actual action is taken.
						
Result: You can view Class results and then drill down to the actual result of the 
        Student by clicking the Student's name. You can also sort the Student's result
		by any of the headers (e.g., Position, Total, Average, Subject scores).
		(***Will have to find a way to make this very very obvious)
		
		Report Card(s) for third term shows cummulative results. 
		
Academic History: Same as the "Check Result" module.
		
Specify School Fees: Specify a school fees amount for this Session/Term/Class.

Enter Fees: You can both enter school fees and view Student's financial record. 
        Click on Student's name to view Student's record. (***Will have to find a way to make this very very obvious)
		Part payment of School Fees can be recorded. 
		You can also void School Fees that has been previously paid.
        
Financial History: Same as Academic History, but for financial records.

School Information: Any update made here is reflected in the School directory as well.
       Uploaded school logo is also reflected in the directory.
	   If a user changes the School's name here, then that changed school name
	   should be used to login next time.
	   (***Will have to find a way to make this very very obvious)
				
Term: You can not add Terms individually. They are added as Sessions are added.
	  This is where you also specify the number of "Times School Open".
	  
Users: Basic functionality. You can change passwords and change pins. 

		
Test Criteria
=======================
Personally re-entered first, second, third term academic information for two Classes. (Fosla Academy)
Promoted them to a new session. 
Tested the pins to make sure they displayed the correct report card, for each student.
Todo: Re-enter financial information for first, second and third term for two classes.

Todo
==========
1. Class result for third term should contain cummulative result
2. Acadbase offline and synching.
